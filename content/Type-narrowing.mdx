# **Introduction to Type Narrowing**

### Overview

The `NarrowApplicationRoot` type is a custom TypeScript type designed to extract and narrow down specific properties from a larger type structure. It leverages TypeScript’s utility types—`Pick` and intersection types (`&`)—to create a type that focuses on a subset of relevant data fields while preserving the core identity of the original type.

###

### Purpose

The primary purpose of `NarrowApplicationRoot` is to streamline the handling of application data by focusing on a specific set of properties within the `ApplicationRoot` type. This is particularly useful when only a specific subset of properties is needed for certain operations, reducing the complexity and improving type safety.

# **Code Examples**

### Type Definition:

```typescript
type NarrowApplicationRoot = Pick<
  ApplicationRoot & {
    ApplicationAddress: Array<
      Pick<
        ApplicationAddress,
        | "FlatNumber"
        | "LevelNumber"
        | "LevelType"
        | "Postcode"
        | "State"
        | "StreetName"
        | "StreetNumber"
        | "StreetType"
        | "SubUnitType"
        | "Suburb"
      >
    >;
  },
  "ObjectID" | "ApplicationAddress"
>;

```
In this example:

1. **Intersection Type (**`&`):
    - Combines the existing `ApplicationRoot` type with a custom object that redefines the `ApplicationAddress` property.
    - The custom object specifies that `ApplicationAddress` is an array, but only includes specific fields from the `ApplicationAddress` type.
2. **Inner** `Pick`:
    - Selects specific fields from the `ApplicationAddress` type, such as `FlatNumber`, `LevelNumber`, `Postcode`, etc.
    - This results in a simplified version of `ApplicationAddress`, only containing the relevant properties.
3. **Outer** `Pick`:
    - Selects two properties, `ObjectID` and `ApplicationAddress`, from the combined intersection type.
    - The result is a type that has only these two properties, with `ApplicationAddress` now being a narrowed-down array of address details.


```typescript
type ApplicationRoot = {
  ObjectID: string;
  ApplicantName: string;
  ApplicationDate: Date;
  ApplicationAddress: ApplicationAddress[];
};
type ApplicationAddress = {
  FlatNumber: string;
  LevelNumber: string;
  LevelType: string;
  Postcode: string;
  State: string;
  StreetName: string;
  StreetNumber: string;
  StreetType: string;
  SubUnitType: string;
  Suburb: string;
  Country: string;
};
```

### Using `NarrowApplicationRoot`

Suppose you are developing a feature that only requires the `ObjectID` and specific address details (`FlatNumber`, `LevelNumber`, etc.), and you want to avoid loading or manipulating unnecessary data. Here’s how `NarrowApplicationRoot` can be used:

```typescript
const application: NarrowApplicationRoot = {
  ObjectID: "12345",
  ApplicationAddress: [
    {
      FlatNumber: "1A",
      LevelNumber: "2",
      LevelType: "Floor",
      Postcode: "1234",
      State: "NY",
      StreetName: "Main",
      StreetNumber: "123",
      StreetType: "St",
      SubUnitType: "Apt",
      Suburb: "Suburbia",
    },
  ],
};

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Only the necessary data fields are included, making the data structure leaner and easier to work with.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that only the expected fields are used, preventing accidental usage of unrelated properties.
- **Readability**: Simplifies the understanding of the type structure by focusing on relevant fields.
```
# **Conclusion**
### Conclusion

The `NarrowApplicationRoot` type is a powerful tool for narrowing down large, complex types into more manageable and focused subsets. By combining intersection types and utility types like `Pick`, TypeScript developers can create highly specific types tailored to their application's needs, improving both the efficiency and clarity of their code.
